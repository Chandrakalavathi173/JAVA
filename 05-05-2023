JAVA:

FEATURES OF JAVA:
--> it is a simple programming language
--> it is an object oriented language:
    1.concepts of object and class    
        >> object is a real world existance  like the human , tree, book
        --> properties include -- name
                               -- height  
                               -- age
        --> Actions include -- running
                            -- eating  
                            -- barking
        --> proprties are the variables and actions are the functions
        
        >> class is a group of objects exhibiting same behaviour (properties and actions)
        example:
        Dog comes under a class and the properties like name weight age are the variables and actions like barking , eating are the functions.
        Then Dog d1, Dog d2, Dog d3 are some objects to the class Dog.
       
IS JAVA A PURELY OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE ?
---> it isn't truely a object oriented language
---> object oriented language contains only objects and classes. that is it shouldn't contain primitive data types like int float char, But in java we have the data types .
---> And it is observed that multiple inheritance isn't supported by java.

JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE:
JVM it is the heart of entire java programming.
it is used in converting the .class file(byte code) into machine code
